# Haxinator 2000 ðŸš€

Your Swiss Army Knife for Network Tunneling and Penetration Testing

## Features

- **ICMP Tunneling**: Bypass firewalls using Hans VPN
- **DNS Tunneling**: Sneak through DNS with Iodine
- **OpenVPN Support**: Traditional VPN when you need it
- **WiFi & AP**: Connect to networks or create your own
- **Bluetooth Serial**: Easy serial access with auto-pairing

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Create your secrets file:
   ```bash
   cp haxinator-pigen-overlay/stage2/02-custom-config/root_files/files/env-secrets.template ~/.haxinator-secrets
   ```
3. Edit `~/.haxinator-secrets` with your configuration
4. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   sudo ./01-build-script.sh
   ```

## Working with Images

### Mounting Images
After building, you can mount the image for inspection or modification:
```bash
sudo ./img-mount.sh
```
This script will:
- Find the most recent .img file in `./pi-gen/deploy`
- Mount both boot and root partitions
- Clean up any existing mounts automatically
- Display mount points for easy access

### Unmounting Images
When you're done working with the image:
```bash
sudo ./img-unmount.sh
```
This script will:
- Verify all configurations are present
- Safely unmount all partitions
- Detach loop devices
- Clean up mount points

### Mount Points
- Boot partition: `/mnt/boot`
- Root partition: `/mnt/root`

### Verification
The unmount script performs several checks:
- Network configurations
- Service files
- SSL certificates
- PHP settings
- Bluetooth configuration
- Web server setup

## Configuration Guide

The Haxinator 2000 uses a secrets file to configure its various services. Create this file by copying the template:

```bash
cp haxinator-pigen-overlay/stage2/02-custom-config/root_files/files/env-secrets.template ~/.haxinator-secrets
```

### Service Requirements

#### Bluetooth Auto-Pairing
```bash
BLUETOOTH_MAC=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```
- Set this to your device's MAC address for automatic discovery and pairing
- Enables easy serial access over Bluetooth
- Leave as XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX to disable auto-pairing

#### OpenVPN Connection
```bash
VPN_USER=your_username
VPN_PASS=your_password
```
- Both values required for OpenVPN setup
- Leave empty to disable OpenVPN

#### Iodine DNS Tunnel
```bash
IODINE_TOPDOMAIN=your_domain
IODINE_NAMESERVER=your_nameserver_ip
IODINE_PASS=your_password
IODINE_MTU=1400
IODINE_LAZY=true
IODINE_INTERVAL=4
```
- Required values: `IODINE_TOPDOMAIN`, `IODINE_NAMESERVER`, `IODINE_PASS`
- Optional values have defaults shown above
- Leave required values empty to disable Iodine

#### Hans VPN (ICMP Tunnel)
```bash
HANS_SERVER=your_server_ip
HANS_PASSWORD=your_password
```
- Both values required for Hans VPN setup
- Leave empty to disable Hans VPN

#### WiFi Access Point
```bash
WIFI_SSID="Haxinator 2000"
WIFI_PASSWORD="ChangeMe"
```
- Both values required for AP setup
- Default values shown above
- Leave empty to disable AP mode

### How It Works

1. The build process reads your `~/.haxinator-secrets` file
2. Creates necessary configuration files in the image
3. On first boot, only services with complete configuration are enabled
4. Services with missing or template values are automatically disabled

### Security Notes

- Keep your `~/.haxinator-secrets` file secure (permissions 600)
- Never commit this file to version control
- The template file is safe to commit as it contains no real values

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Not Starting**
   - Check if all required values are set in `~/.haxinator-secrets`
   - Verify the service is enabled in the image

2. **Bluetooth Not Pairing**
   - Ensure `BLUETOOTH_MAC` is set to your device's address
   - Check if Bluetooth service is enabled

3. **VPN Connections Failing**
   - Verify all required credentials are set
   - Check network connectivity to VPN servers
